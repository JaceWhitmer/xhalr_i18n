If you have a language you want to add, please help us out. Go to https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php if you don't know your language 2 character code, and use that code to name your language file.  Don't forget to include your name as a contributor on your language file, and include a link so that we can thank you on the translation page.
